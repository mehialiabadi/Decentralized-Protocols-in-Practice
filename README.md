# Developing a decentralized E-voting Protocol which is described on the following paper.
To understand the protocol details please read the paper carefully. 
To run, every voter needs an account on the ethereum network (we have hauched it on the Testnet network)
It's easy and simple just follow the instruction.


Compile  contracts using Remixide, then deploy them on the test network.
After deploying each contract, it provides a contract address.
